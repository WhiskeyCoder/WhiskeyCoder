### :man_technologist: About Me :
I am actually a new coder, I come from the world of security, love to have fun, drink good drinks and come up with crazy projects. If your wondering the coding knowledge I have here is from bordem after a few drinks with friends. At the moment it involves alot of AI projects, using local LLM's and prompt engineering. 

- :telescope: I work in security, and have nothing to do with coding at all...
- :seedling: I code because its fun, and I end up getting wacky ideas that lead to some fun projects
- :zap: In my free time, I code, those wacky projects
